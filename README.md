# Rect

Rect is a front-end framework for easily assembling responsive pages in a responsive, rectangle layout.

Rect allows you to declate the shape and size of each box for desktop and mobile states.

Rect supports dynamically responsive fonts so the text always scales relative to the size of the box. 

Rect is only 21.2 KB when minimized, and 3.7 KB using gzip.
