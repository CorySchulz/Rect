# Rect

Rect is a front-end framework for quickly assembling pages in a responsive, rectangular layout.

Rect allows you to declate the shape and size of each box for desktop and mobile states using a 16 column grid for the desktop view and an 8 column grid for mobile.

Rect offers dynamically responsive fonts so the text always scales relative to the size of the box. 

Rect is only 21.2 KB when minimized, and 3.7 KB using gzip.
